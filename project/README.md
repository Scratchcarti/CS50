# CENTRALIZE AND ANALYZE
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/tGMyO4uobiA
#### Description:
chess.com is the most famous chess website out there.
but there is a slight problem with it, whenever you click to begin gameplay, the chessboard is not placed in centre.
its in the left side of screen. maybe this was done so that it would be easy for streamers to read chat while playing chess but for normal users it feels like waste of space on webpage.
Also, the analyze feature is pay walled at chess.com but there are websites out there which do it for free.
This extension moves the chessboard to  middle of the screen
And when in the analyze section of chess.com, when the extension icon is clicked it copies the pgn of the chess.com game which it was clicked on and pastes it in lichess.org analysis page which is free to use.
